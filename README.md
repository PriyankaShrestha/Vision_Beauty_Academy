 **Vision Beauty Academy and Makeup Studio**
 
 
 Vision Beauty and Makeup Studio is a beauty academy which also provides beauty services. It is owned by Mrs. Prina Shrestha who is my sister and my client for this project. I am going to build an application for my client which will help her to manage the classes and students, to share the materials through an app, book an appointment for a service and a platform where the students can share and show off their talent.
