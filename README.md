 **Vision Beauty Academy and Makeup Studio**
 
 
Vision Beauty and Makeup Studio is a beauty academy which also provides beauty services. It is owned by Mrs. Prina Shrestha who is my client for this project. The app will have functionalities such as adding, editing, viewing and deleting the services, courses, bookings and images. The app will also help my client to manager the classes and students in a easier way.
